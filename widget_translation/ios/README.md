Hey !

Welcome to the iOS widget translation guide:

The whole translation of the widget is available in the [Localizable.xcstrings](./Localizable.xcstrings) file.

## üõ†Ô∏è Contribution Methods

### 1. Xcode (Recommended)

To open it properly and contribute easily I recommend taking a look at **[this article](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/localizing-and-varying-text-with-a-string-catalog)** from the Xcode documentation, I learned everything here and it's really complete.

### 2. Online Tool (No Xcode)

If you do not have access to Xcode, **[this website](https://localizify.swiftapps.us/translate)** can help to translate using a nice interface !
